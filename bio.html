								<p>Dr. Mariano Phielipp is a scientist and engineer, specializing in Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. His experience includes robotic learning, computer vision, face recognition and detection, object categorization, recommendation systems, online learning, automatic rule learning, natural language processing, knowledge representation, and energy-based algorithms.</p>
								
								<p>In his recent role at Intel's AI Labs, Mariano's team partners with the external academic community to use data sources such as natural language, perception, and action in robotics, AI for Science and combinatorial optimization problems, resulting in advanced and efficient learning systems. Their collective efforts refine the capabilities of decision-making systems and set new standards for the AI landscape.</p>
								
								<p>He has spent 18 years with Intel, from software engineer, to Applied Research, Machine Learning and AI R&D, before promotion to Senior Deep Learning Data Scientist on the Artificial Intelligence Product Group / Nervana team in 2017. He moved the following year to Deep Reinforcement Learning Researcher and Applied Researcher at Intel Labs before promotion to his recent role, Principal Engineer, in 2020. This role focuses on the intricacies of robotics, decision making, and AI for Science, and has led to the development of innovative, efficient, goal-oriented policies.</p>
								
								<p>His early career was spent as an engineer in software development, including Inenco, an End-to-End Technology Solution Provider.</p>
								
								<h3>Education & Research</h3>
								<p>Mariano holds a PhD in Computer Science with Graphics, Visualization, CAGD, AI, Machine Learning and Visual Perception from Arizona State, where he also took his Master's in Computer Science. His research findings have been published at leading conferences and workshops such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, CORL, IROS, ICRA, IEEE, SPIE, IASTED, and EUROGRAPHICS-IEEE, and he has also delivered keynote addresses.</p>
								
								<p>He participates in disclosure committees, holds granted and pending patents, and has received awards for his contributions to robotics. He describes himself as fortunate to have collaborated with Pieter Abbeel, Ken Goldberg, Sergey Levine, and Chelsea Finn, as well as researchers from the University of Toronto, MILA and ASU.</p>
