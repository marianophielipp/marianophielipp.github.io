A practical solution to the problem could have far reaching implications in many industries, such as home entertainment. In this work, we consider the problem of identity inference using a TV remote control. In particular, we address two challenges that have so far prevented the work of Chang et al.(2009) from being applied in a home entertainment system. First, we show how to learn the patterns of TV remote controls incrementally and online. Second, we generalize our results to partially labeled data. To achieve our goal, we use state-of-the-art methods for max-margin learning and online convex programming. Our solution is efficient, runs in real time, and comes with theoretical guarantees. It performs well in practice and we demonstrate this on 4 datasets of 2 to 4 people.",

      "snippet": "In 2009, an average American spent 3 hours per day watching TV. Recent advances in TV entertainment technologies, such as on-demand content, browsing the Internet, and 3D displays, have changed the traditional role of the TV and turned it into the center of home entertainment. Most of these technologies are personal and would benefit from seamless identification of who sits in front of the TV. In this work, we propose a practical and highly accurate solution to this problem. This solution uses a camera, which is mounted on a TV, to recognize faces of people in front of the TV. To make the approach practical, we employ online learning on graphs and show that we can learn highly accurate face models in difficult circumstances from as little as one labeled example. To evaluate our solutions, we collected a 10-hour long dataset of 8 people who watch TV. Our precision and recall are in the upper nineties, and show the promise of utilizing our approach in an embedded setting.",

A good example of this is face image retrieval. Mathematically-based face indexing methods that are not based primarily on how humans perceive faces can produce retrievals that are disappointing to human users. This raises the question \"Can human faces be automatically indexed in a manner that correlates well with human perception of similarity?\" Humans use words to describe faces - words such as braided, graybearded, bearded, bespectacled, bald, blondish, blond, freckled, blue eyed, mustached, pale, Caucasian, brown eyed, dark skinned, or black eyed. Such words represent dimensions that span a shared concept space for faces. Therefore they might provide a useful guide to indexing faces in an intuitive manner. This paper describes \u2026",

      "snippet": "Reinforcement learning is difficult to apply to real world problems due to high sample complexity, the need to adapt to frequent distribution shifts and the complexities of learning from high-dimensional inputs, such as images. Over the last several years, meta-learning has emerged as a promising approach to tackle these problems by explicitly training an agent to quickly adapt to new tasks. However, such methods still require huge amounts of data during training and are difficult to optimize in high-dimensional domains. One potential solution is to consider offline or batch meta-reinforcement learning (RL) - learning from existing datasets without additional environment interactions during training. In this work we develop the first offline model-based meta-RL algorithm that operates from images in tasks with sparse rewards. Our approach has three main components: a novel strategy to construct meta-exploration trajectories from offline data, which allows agents to learn meaningful meta-test time task inference strategy; representation learning via variational filtering and latent conservative model-free policy optimization. We show that our method completely solves a realistic meta-learning task involving robot manipulation, while naive combinations of previous approaches fail.",

Simulated Annealing (SA) has been the method of choice for tackling classical floorplanning problems where the objective is to minimize wire-length and the total placement area. The goal in industry-relevant floorplanning problems, however, is not only to minimize area and wire-length, but to do that while respecting hard placement constraints that specify the general area and/or the specific locations for the placement of some blocks. We show that simply incorporating these constraints into the SA objective function leads to sub-optimal, and often illegal, solutions. We propose the Constraints-Aware Simulated Annealing (CA-SA) method and show that it strongly outperforms vanilla SA in floorplanning problems with hard placement constraints. We developed a new floorplanning tool on top of CA-SA: PARSAC (Parallel Simulated Annealing with Constraints). PARSAC is an efficient, easy-to-use, and massively parallel floorplanner. Unlike current SA-based or learning-based floorplanning tools that cannot effectively incorporate hard placement-constraints, PARSAC can quickly construct the Pareto-optimal legal solutions front for constrained floorplanning problems. PARSAC also outperforms traditional SA on legacy floorplanning benchmarks. PARSAC is available as an open-source repository for researchers to replicate and build on our result.",

In this work, we address this issue by creating benchmarks for OPC with Confidence (OPCC), derived by adding sets of policy comparison queries to datasets from offline reinforcement learning. In addition, we present an empirical evaluation of the risk versus coverage trade-off for a class of model-based baselines. In particular, the baselines learn ensembles of dynamics models, which are used in various ways to produce simulations for answering queries with confidence values.

Adversarial imitation learning algorithms alleviate this issue by learning to match the expert state-action distribution through additional environment interactions.

Prior work has shown that it is possible to learn inter-agent communication protocols using multi-agent reinforcement learning and message-passing network architectures. However, these models use an unconstrained broadcast communication model, in which an agent communicates with all other agents at every step, even when the task does not require it. In real-world applications, where communication may be limited by system constraints like bandwidth, power and network capacity, one might need to reduce the number of messages that are sent. In this work, we explore a simple method of minimizing communication while maximizing performance in multi-task learning: simultaneously optimizing a task-specific objective and a communication penalty. We show that the objectives can be optimized using Reinforce and the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization. We introduce two techniques to stabilize training: 50% training and message forwarding. Training with the communication penalty on only 50% of the episodes prevents our models from turning off their outgoing messages. Second, repeating messages received previously helps models retain information, and further improves performance. With these techniques, we show that we can reduce communication by 75% with no loss of performance.",

Unfortunately, these policies still have sub-optimal zero-shot performance compared to end-to-end finetuning on target morphologies. This limitation has ramifications in practical robotic applications, as online finetuning large neural networks can require immense computation. In this work, we investigate \\textit{parameter efficient finetuning} techniques to specialize morphology-agnostic policies to a target robot that minimizes the number of learnable parameters adapted during online learning. We compare direct finetuning,  which update subsets of the base model parameters, and input-learnable approaches, which add additional parameters to manipulate inputs passed to the base model. Our analysis concludes that tuning relatively few parameters (0.01\\% of the base model) can measurably improve policy performance over zero shot.

In this paper, we describe Maximize Ensemble Diversity in Reinforcement Learning (MED-RL), a set of regularization methods inspired from the economics and consensus optimization to improve diversity in the ensemble-based deep reinforcement learning methods by encouraging inequality between the networks during training. We integrated MED-RL in five of the most common ensemble-based deep RL algorithms for both continuous and discrete control tasks and evaluated on six Mujoco environments and six Atari games.

First, we learn an embedded neural dynamics model from demonstration transitions and further fine-tune it with the replay buffer. Next, we reward the agents for staying close to the demonstrated trajectories using a distance metric defined in the embedding space.

However, most approaches focus on extracting policy parameters from execution traces alone (ie, motion trajectories and perceptual data). No adequate communication channel exists between the human expert and the robot to describe critical aspects of the task, such as the properties of the target object or the intended shape of the motion. Motivated by insights into the human teaching process, we introduce a method for incorporating unstructured natural language into imitation learning. At training time, the expert can provide demonstrations along with verbal descriptions in order to describe the underlying intent (eg,\" go to the large green bowl\"). The training process then interrelates these two modalities to encode the correlations between language, perception, and motion. The resulting language-conditioned visuomotor policies can be conditioned at runtime on new human commands and instructions, which allows for more fine-grained control over the trained policies while also reducing situational ambiguity. We demonstrate in a set of simulation experiments how our approach can learn language-conditioned manipulation policies for a seven-degree-of-freedom robot arm and compare the results to a variety of alternative methods.",

Understanding the generalization properties of RL is one of the challenges of modern machine learning. Towards this goal, we analyze policy learning in the context of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) and formalize the dynamics of training levels as instances. We prove that, independently of the exploration strategy, reusing instances introduces significant changes on the effective Markov dynamics the agent observes during training. Maximizing expected rewards impacts the learned belief state of the agent by inducing undesired instance-specific speed-running policies instead of generalizable ones, which are sub-optimal on the training set. We provide generalization bounds to the value gap in train and test environments based on the number of training instances, and use insights based on these to improve performance on unseen levels. We propose training a shared belief representation over an ensemble of specialized policies, from which we compute a consensus policy that is used for data collection, disallowing instance-specific exploitation.

Motivated by this, we systematically analyze how various modifications to the ground-truth goal-space affect learning in hierarchical models with the aim of identifying important properties of optimal goal spaces. Our results show that, while rotation of ground-truth goal spaces and noise had no effect, having additional unnecessary factors significantly impaired learning in hierarchical models.",

While SMILES and SELFIES leverage atomic representations, Group SELFIES builds on top of the chemical robustness guarantees of SELFIES by enabling group tokens, thereby creating additional flexibility to the representation. Moreover, the group tokens in Group SELFIES can take advantage of inductive biases of molecular fragments that capture meaningful chemical motifs.

The latter is particularly problematic when applying RL to robotics, where detecting whether the desired configuration is reached might require considerable supervision and instrumentation. Furthermore, we are often interested in being able to reach a wide range of configurations, hence setting up a different reward every time might be unpractical. Methods like Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) have recently shown promise to learn policies able to reach many goals, without the need of a reward. Unfortunately, without tricks like resetting to points along the trajectory, HER might require many samples to discover how to reach certain areas of the state-space. In this work we propose a novel algorithm goalGAIL, which incorporates demonstrations to drastically speed up the convergence to a policy able to reach any goal, surpassing the performance of an agent trained with other Imitation Learning algorithms. Furthermore, we show our method can also be used when the available expert trajectories do not contain the actions or when the expert is suboptimal, which makes it applicable when only kinesthetic, third person or noisy demonstration is available.",

These types of policies have previously been shown to help generalize over dynamic, kinematic, and limb configuration variations between agent morphologies. Unfortunately, these policies still have sub-optimal zero-shot performance compared to end-to-end finetuning on morphologies at deployment. This limitation has ramifications in practical applications such as robotics because further data collection to perform end-to-end finetuning can be computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate combining morphology-aware pretraining with \\textit{parameter efficient finetuning} (PEFT) techniques to help reduce the learnable parameters necessary to specialize a morphology-aware policy to a target embodiment. We compare directly tuning sub-sets of model weights, input learnable adapters, and prefix tuning techniques for online finetuning. Our analysis reveals that PEFT techniques in conjunction with policy pre-training generally help reduce the number of samples to necessary to improve a policy compared to training models end-to-end from scratch. We further find that tuning as few as less than 1\\% of total parameters will improve policy performance compared the zero-shot performance of the base pretrained a policy.",

These design problems are expensive, time-consuming, and traditionally performed by human experts. Moreover, the barriers to domain knowledge make it challenging to propose a universal solution that generalizes to different design problems. In this paper, we propose a new method called  Efficient Design and Stable Control (EDiSon) for automatic design and control in different design problems. The key ideas of our method are (1) interactive sequential modeling of the design and control process and (2) adaptive exploration and design replay. To decompose the difficulty of learning design and control as a whole, we leverage sequential modeling for both the design process and control process, with a design policy to generate step-by-step design proposals and a control policy to optimize the objective by operating the design. With deep reinforcement learning (RL), the policies learn to find good designs by maximizing a reward signal that evaluates the quality of designs. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive exploration and replay mechanism based on a design memory that maintains high-quality designs generated so far. By regulating between constructing a design from scratch or replaying a design from memory to refine it, EDiSon balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in the design space and stabilizes the learning of the control policy.

Through an extensive set of online learning experiments, we show that while RL policies can be effectively trained using machine learning-based proxy reward functions, they fail to converge for DFT-based rewards. This failure of convergence could be related to the inherently noisy nature of DFT in resolving the electronic band structure, which severely affects policy learning. To this end, we emphasize the need for more specialized and domain-driven methods for band gap optimization.",

For crystalline solids, the band gap is an important property for designing semiconductors and batteries. However, optimizing crystals for a target band gap is difficult and not well-explored. Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise towards optimizing crystals, as it can freely explore the chemical space. However, it relies on regular band gap evaluations, which can only be accurately computed through expensive Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations. In this study, we propose an active learning-inspired pipeline that combines RL and DFT simulations for optimizing crystal compositions given a target band gap. The pipeline includes an RL policy for predicting atom types and a band gap network that is fine-tuned with DFT data. Preliminary results indicate the need for furthering the state-of-the-art to address the inherent challenges of the problem.",
